While passing through northern France, I spent some time at a local fab lab, mostly experimenting with the laser cutter. It's quite a satisfying process, and allow to rapidly bring ideas to the physical world.

I got curious how it actually cuts wood so cleanly. Turns out, the laser heats one point until it vaporizes. Gas pressure clears debris and deepens the cut.

To get a feel for how different materials responded, I started with several small test designs in SVG. One was a coaster engraved with a monkey and a simple pattern—mostly to see how engraving and vector lines turned out on thin plywood. The results were crisp, and the machine's presets for common materials helped avoid surprises.

Then came the main project: a small 3D slotted puzzle model of an ibex. This construction method—stacked slices that interlock with slot joints—is a classic in schools, science museums, and DIY kits. I remembered building a life-sized dinosaur with the same technique back in school. It's a simple but clever way to turn flat sheets into solid structures without glue or screws.

The advantage of this approach is its material efficiency and visual clarity: shapes are easily stored, flat-packed, and assembled. The main constraint is that slots must be perfectly aligned and matched to the exact thickness of the board—otherwise the joints are either too loose or won’t fit at all.

For the ibex, I modeled the full shape in Blender, then sliced it into layers spaced to match my 3.2 mm plywood. For each intersection, I had to split the geometry so slices could slot into each other perpendicularly. This meant a lot of boolean operations, and Blender’s mesh tools weren’t always cooperative—often creating broken topology I had to fix by hand. The process was repetitive, and I started thinking it could be automated. A simple add-on could take slice positions and board thickness, and output ready-to-cut 2D layouts. I didn’t find a solution online, but it would be a solid future project.

The final cut took about 20 minutes. The Glowforge runs at around 800–1000W while cutting, so the total energy use was roughly 0.3 kWh—comparable to running a small dishwasher cycle or boiling a few kettles of water. For small batch projects, it’s efficient and surprisingly low-impact, especially with recycled or scrap material.

This short fab lab visit was a great mix of making, learning, and revisiting ideas I’d shelved for a while. I’ll share photos and files soon, along with a few notes for anyone wanting to try similar builds.
